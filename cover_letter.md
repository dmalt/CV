I'd like to express my strong interest in the ML Research Engineer position
at JetBrains. With a deep passion for both code and data science,
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the innovative work
being done at JetBrains Research ML4SE lab.

Having pursued an academic career, I have now decided to pivot towards the
industry, and the prospect of collaborating with a dynamic and innovative team
at JetBrains greatly appeals to me. As a former researcher, I have a robust
background in providing comprehensive analysis pipelines for both myself and my
colleagues. Each new research project required an in-depth exploration of novel
methods and approaches, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and
problem-solving.

The three key aspects of the ML Research Engineer position that resonate with me are:

1. While my past work primarily revolved around research, I have always
   cherished the engineering aspect of my projects. Crafting high-quality code
   that is intended for use by others is something I take great satisfaction in.

2. I am drawn to the challenge of working on new problems.
   The diverse range of projects at JetBrains Research ML4SE lab offers the
   perfect opportunity to apply my problem-solving skills to a variety of
   contexts.

3. The nature of work outlined in the job description greatly appeals to me.
   During the time I was engaged in my thesis, I created a plugin for my editor
   that improved the experience of writing in Cyrillics. I have a strong
   inclination towards working on concrete, useful, and impactful solutions.


I'm excited about the chance to contribute my technical skills, research
background, and passion for coding to the innovative projects at JetBrains.
Thank you for considering my application. Enclosed is my resume for your
review. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experiences
align with your team's goals and how I can contribute to the success of
JetBrains.

Sincerely,
Dmitrii Altukhov.
