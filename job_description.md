# ML Research Engineer

[link](https://www.jetbrains.com/careers/jobs/ml-research-engineer-913/)

At JetBrains, code is our passion. Ever since we started, back in 2000, we have
strived to make the most effective developer tools on earth. By automating
routine checks and corrections, our tools speed up production, freeing
developers to grow, discover, and create.

The JetBrains Research ML4SE lab explores ways to use machine learning and data
science techniques to help developers and enhance software development
processes. Our work aims to bridge the gap between academic advances in the
field of machine learning for software engineering and their practical
applications.

Our lab is looking for a research engineer to help with projects spanning a
variety of areas of expertise. Most of the research projects in our lab require
significant technical effort at all stages, from data collection to model
deployment. Though the ideal candidate is not expected to have expertise in the
fields relevant to all of the projects we work on, we are looking for someone
excited to take on the challenge of performing rigorous technical analysis in
diverse contexts.

In this role, you will:

- Develop end-to-end machine learning pipelines that work with software
  artifacts and source code.
- Apply and develop tools for large-scale processing of source code and other
  development artifacts.
- Develop plugins for IntelliJ-based IDEs and other JetBrains products.

We’ll be happy to have you on our team if you have:

- Experience with Python.
- Experience with Java, Kotlin, or another object-oriented programming language.
- The ability to write clean code that is easy to read and maintain.
- Knowledge of mathematical statistics and machine learning algorithms.
- Experience implementing end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
- Experience with large-scale data processing.
We don’t expect you to fit all of these criteria, but we are looking for
someone who has the expertise to strongly perform and consult colleagues in
some of these areas.

We’ll be especially thrilled if you:

- Have experience applying machine learning to source code or natural language.
- Have experience developing complex applications or libraries.
- Follow the best practices of software development and maintenance.

We offer:

- Fascinating work in a dynamic, friendly team.
- Competitive salary.
- Flexible working schedule.
- Six weeks of paid vacation (local regulations may apply).
- A comfortable working environment with ergonomic workplaces, fitness and
  leisure facilities.
- Excellent professional and personal development opportunities and the
  possibility to travel to professional conferences worldwide.
- Additional benefits including lunch, commute, insurance, and language course
  reimbursement, free refreshments and snacks in the office, and more.
