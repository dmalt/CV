About the job
We're Creative Fabrica, a fast scaling tech start-up from Amsterdam.

Our mission

Enable creativity by giving access to everything related to the creative
process: inspiration, learning, creating and sharing. The 'Creative Inspiration
Flywheel'

This creates a self-sustaining community that lives within the Creative Fabrica ecosystem.

About The Platform

We launched in 2016 as a marketplace for fonts with a subscription service. In
the last 7 years we have been through tremendous growth, and we're just getting
started!

We have scaled to 40 million+ monthly page views, viewing over 10 million+
listed products from 14000+ active designers.

Our focus is to create a platform for designers that enables them to offer
exceptional high-quality content. We make their products searchable in unique
ways. This allows our customers to speed up their workflow, allowing them to
focus on what they love most: Creating.

We are growing. Fast. You will help us grow even faster.

You will be working on the forefront of the generative AI revolution,
optimizing and scaling out the experimentation and generation engine at the
heart of our quickly evolving customer-facing content experience.

The tasks include building a powerful scalable Python application with ML
models at its heart. While optimizing models is important, the surrounding tool
box of functions regarding image processing, dataset preparation and model
evaluation need to be performant, flexible and compatible. Good understanding
of libraries such as Numpy, OpenCV, Pillow and others is required, as well as a
deep understanding of Python and its native libraries.

What you will do:

Write, deploy and test production-grade Python code. 
Integrate ML models into deployable Python applications. 
Participate in and lead design reviews with peers and stakeholders. 
Review code developed by other developers and provide feedback to ensure the
consistent application of team best practices. 
Contribute to system documentation and team knowledge sharing. 

And to have a glimpse of some of the amazing stuff we do on the tech side, here
is a fresh piece by An Tran, our Head of Engineering about how Creative Fabrica
is supporting creators with Generative AI.

What you will bring:

At Creative Fabrica, your path to success is paved when you thrive in a dynamic
and occasionally ambiguous environment. We highly appreciate proactive
individuals who actively seek and provide kind and constructive feedback. And
we really dig a solutions driven problem solver with a keen eye on innovation.
Moreover, a genuine enthusiasm for learning and a dedication to personal and
professional development are qualities we value. Having excellent verbal and
written communication skills definitely helps here too!

And here are the specific skills and capabilities we are looking for in this role:

Expertise with software development in Python
Experience with ML/DL frameworks (e.g. PyTorch)
Experience with image processing in Python
Experience with engineering principles, best practices and common tool chain
Git
CI/CD
Testing / Profiling
Observability
Experience interfacing with other frameworks and languages to improve code
performance, for instance JIT compilers, cython, etc
Experience with cloud infrastructure tools such as SQS, Kafka, S3, etc

Let us take care of you.

We embrace state-of-the-art technologies. We firmly believe in the potential of
AI as the future of work. You will see us using Copilot and ChatGPT in our
daily work. 
Competitive Compensation: We believe that hard work, skills and ambition should
be fairly compensated. 
Flexibility: 30 remote days per year. Need a change of scene? Take your laptop, pack a bag and work from the woods, your parents' place or the beach. 
The best tools and stylish kit: Laptop. Check. Collaboration tools. Check. Killer accessories. Check, check and check again!
Awesome Office: Based in a beautiful office in the centre, working here means delicious lunches in the garden, Friday beers at our local bar, and access to our own CF library. 
TGIF: Work Life balance is important - we work hard together, and we have fun together. On Fridays we gather at the bar across the street and start celebrating the weekend.
